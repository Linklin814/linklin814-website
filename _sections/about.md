Hi, I'm Iliyan — an undergrad studying Politics and International Relations, based in London.

I've been into technology for ages, from when I was a baby smashing laptops with a hammer to now with a mini server cluster at home. I self-host a ton of services for personal use as well as a 3-node Proxmox cluster.
